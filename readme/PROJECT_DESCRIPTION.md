##Kazakhstan: Save Tuba – Gamifying Sustainability Education for Kazakhstan’s Youngest Learners

Lead Mentor: Sean Vassilaros, Computer Science and Business

###Project Description:
Save Tuba (savetuba.com) is an educational platform for Kazakhstan’s youngest citizens that builds knowledge of environmental sustainability and reinforces sustainable habits. Currently, Kazakhstan is facing significant challenges with plastics pollution, poor outdoor air quality, and other negative environmental consequences. Through the education and empowerment of Kazakhstan’s youngest learners, the team is working to make Kazakhstan’s sustainable future a reality. The Save Tuba project is a joint initiative with our partners in Kazakhstan: Abai University (Abai KazNPU) and Almaty Management University (AlmaU). We are looking towards a pilot launch in several schools across the city of Almaty starting in 2025. 

Our educational platform consists of two main parts, detailed below. Students interested in mobile development, DevOps, graphics design, and UI/UX are highly encouraged to join.

1. Mobile app on iOS & Android. The core feature of our app is a gamified set of 800+ interactive minigames based on Kazakhstan’s natural science curriculum. The minigames are hooked up to real-time leaderboards, achievement badge systems, and instant completion feedback. Team members will work on maintaining and deploying the app into a production environment with low-wifi connectivity.

2. Desktop web-based teacher interface. Our web application is a fully-fledged learning management system for the Save Tuba mobile app, specifically designed for teachers with the imperative of making teachers’ lives easier. Ease of use is prioritized through mechanisms such as automatic grading of student completions, clear and simple presentation of weekly metrics, and the ability to assign lessons with the click of a button. Team members will work extensively with teachers to gather feedback and ensure rapid prototyping of requested features whilst maintaining a seamless UI/UX experience. 

*Note that all students on the project team will be expected to travel for fieldwork. The non-capstone team in GSIF is open to all majors, with priority consideration given to students with interests in environmental studies, business, and education.
